@media screen and (max-width:600px){
    body{
        background-color: yellow;
    }
}

@media screen and (min-width:601px){
    body{
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}

/*I used 2 media queries, one for screens with a width bigger than and equal to, and one smaller than 601px. 
I then created a css rule for the body element in each of the queries to change the color to yellow and blue depending on which query it was in.
It looks different in different viewsizes because the width of the screen will be either in the yellow or blue query, depending on the width of the screen size.
